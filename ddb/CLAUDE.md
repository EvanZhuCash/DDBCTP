# CLAUDE.md - DolphinDB Streaming Trading System

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with the DolphinDB-based streaming trading system in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a **real-time streaming trading system** built on DolphinDB with adaptive learning capabilities. The system features complete data flow from market data distribution through strategy execution to performance-based learning with **perfect 1:1 matching** in backtest mode.

## Core Architecture

### Data Flow Pipeline
```
Market Data (DFS) → StreamBroadcastEngine → Unified Distribution → Strategies → Signal Collection → Exchange → Performance → Adaptive Feedback
```

### System Status - FULLY OPERATIONAL ✅
- **✅ Market Data Distribution**: 165,540 records via StreamBroadcastEngine
- **✅ Strategy Framework**: 4 trading strategies (all operational)
- **✅ Signal Collection**: 173,026 unified signals with perfect aggregation
- **✅ Exchange Engine**: 10,573 trades with 100% fill rate (1:1 matching)
- **✅ Performance Engine**: 9,427 performance records (timestamp-based)
- **✅ Adaptive Learning**: Strategy 4 performance-based optimization

## System Execution

IMPORTANT: always run original_cleanup.py for thorough cleanup of the system. 
IMPORTANT: do not use --sequential or --delays with ddb_conn.py.

### Backtest Mode (Perfect 1:1 Matching)
```bash
# Complete backtest execution (sequential order - WORKING!)
python3 ddb_conn.py --sequential dominant_contract_stream.dos unified_data_distribution.dos strat1.dos strat2.dos strat3.dos strat4.dos signal_collection.dos exchange.dos performance.dos

# Alternative step-by-step execution:
python3 ddb_conn.py dominant_contract_stream.dos      # Load market data
python3 ddb_conn.py unified_data_distribution.dos     # Distribute to strategies  
python3 ddb_conn.py strat1.dos strat2.dos strat3.dos strat4.dos  # Generate signals
python3 ddb_conn.py signal_collection.dos             # Aggregate signals
python3 ddb_conn.py exchange.dos                       # Execute trades
python3 ddb_conn.py performance.dos                    # Calculate performance

# Results: Signals = Orders = Trades, Performance = Timestamps
# Backtest tables: backtestOrders, backtestTrades, backtestPerformance
```

### Live Mode (Real-time Streaming)
```bash
# Live trading execution (concurrent mode required)
python3 ddb_conn.py dominant_contract_stream.dos &    # Market data feed
python3 ddb_conn.py unified_data_distribution.dos &   # Real-time distribution
python3 ddb_conn.py strat1.dos strat2.dos strat3.dos strat4.dos &  # Concurrent strategies
python3 ddb_conn.py signal_collection.dos &           # Real-time signal aggregation
python3 ddb_conn.py exchange.dos &                     # Live trade execution
python3 ddb_conn.py performance.dos &                  # Real-time performance

# Results: Live streaming with adaptive feedback
# Live tables: exchangeOrders, exchangeTrades, performanceMetrics
```

### Quick Start (One Command)
```bash
# Execute complete backtest system
python3 ddb_conn.py dominant_contract_stream.dos unified_data_distribution.dos strat1.dos strat2.dos strat3.dos strat4.dos signal_collection.dos exchange.dos performance.dos
```

### Key Streaming Engines

#### 1. StreamBroadcastEngine (Market Data Distribution)
- **Purpose**: Efficient many-to-many market data distribution
- **Input**: DFS database streams
- **Output**: unifiedMarketData table
- **Subscriptions**: 4 strategy subscriptions (strat1-4_market_data)

#### 2. TimeSeriesEngine (Strategy 1 & 2)
- **Purpose**: Momentum calculation with time windows
- **Configuration**: windowSize=20, step=1, triggeringPattern='perRow'
- **Input**: Market data feeds (momentumFeedY1, momentumFeedM1, etc.)
- **Output**: Strategy signals via ReactiveStateEngine

#### 3. CrossSectionalEngine (Strategy 3)
- **Purpose**: Bollinger Bands across multiple symbols
- **Configuration**: Cross-sectional analysis with ta::bBands function
- **Input**: tickStream3 (multi-symbol data)
- **Output**: Cross-sectional trading signals

#### 4. ReactiveStateEngine (All Strategies)
- **Purpose**: Convert calculated metrics to trading signals
- **Logic**: BUY/SELL/NO_TRADE signal generation
- **Output**: Strategy-specific signal tables

## System Configuration

### Backtest vs Live Mode Differences

#### Backtest Mode
- **Fill Rate**: 100% (deterministic)
- **Timing**: All signals processed sequentially  
- **Tables**: backtestOrders, backtestTrades, backtestPerformance
- **Matching**: Perfect 1:1 (Signals = Orders = Trades)
- **Performance**: Timestamp-based (Performance records = Unique timestamps)

#### Live Mode  
- **Fill Rate**: Configurable (default 80-95%)
- **Timing**: Real-time streaming with latency
- **Tables**: exchangeOrders, exchangeTrades, performanceMetrics
- **Matching**: Market realistic (partial fills, rejections)
- **Performance**: Trade-based with real-time feedback

### Critical Subscription Patterns

#### Market Data Distribution
```dolphindb
// StreamBroadcastEngine distributes to all strategies
subscribeTable(tableName=`unifiedMarketData, actionName="strat1_market_data", handler=processStrategy1Data)
subscribeTable(tableName=`unifiedMarketData, actionName="strat2_market_data", handler=processStrategy2Data)
subscribeTable(tableName=`unifiedMarketData, actionName="strat3_market_data", handler=processStrategy3Data)
subscribeTable(tableName=`unifiedMarketData, actionName="strat4_market_data", handler=processStrategy4Data)
```

#### Signal Collection
```dolphindb
// All strategy signals flow to unified collection
subscribeTable(tableName=`strat1Signals, actionName="signal_collector_1", handler=collectToUnified)
subscribeTable(tableName=`strat2Signals, actionName="signal_collector_2", handler=collectToUnified)
subscribeTable(tableName=`strat3Signals, actionName="signal_collector_3", handler=collectToUnified)
subscribeTable(tableName=`strat4Signals, actionName="signal_collector_4", handler=collectToUnified)
```

#### Exchange Processing
```dolphindb
// Exchange processes unified signals
subscribeTable(tableName=`unifiedSignals, actionName="exchange_signal_processor", handler=processTradeSignals)
```

#### Performance Calculation
```dolphindb
// Performance monitors all trades
subscribeTable(tableName=`backtestTrades, actionName="performance_trade_processor", handler=calculatePerformance)
subscribeTable(tableName=`performanceFeedback, actionName="strat4_performance_learning", handler=adaptiveStrategy4)
```

## Query Examples

### Performance Analysis Queries
```dolphindb
// Monthly performance by strategy
select monthBegin(timestamp) as month, 
       sum(pnl) as monthly_pnl,
       avg(sharpe_ratio) as avg_sharpe
from backtestPerformance 
group by month, strategy_id
order by month desc

// Cross-strategy comparison
select strategy_id, symbol,
       count(*) as trades,
       sum(pnl) as total_pnl,
       avg(execution_price) as avg_price
from backtestTrades
group by strategy_id, symbol
order by total_pnl desc

// Risk metrics calculation
select avg(pnl) as avg_pnl,
       std(pnl) as pnl_volatility,
       min(cumulative_pnl) as max_drawdown,
       max(sharpe_ratio) as best_sharpe
from backtestPerformance
```

### Signal Analysis Queries
```dolphindb
// Signal distribution by strategy
select strategy_id, signal, count(*) as count
from unifiedSignals
group by strategy_id, signal
pivot by signal

// Trading signal efficiency
select strategy_id,
       count(*) as total_signals,
       sum(case when signal != "NO_TRADE" then 1 else 0 end) as trading_signals,
       sum(case when signal != "NO_TRADE" then 1 else 0 end) * 100.0 / count(*) as signal_efficiency
from unifiedSignals
group by strategy_id
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Table Not Found**: Ensure all scripts executed in correct order
2. **Subscription Conflicts**: Use unique actionName for each subscription
3. **Memory Issues**: Monitor table sizes, clear old data if needed
4. **Timing Issues**: In live mode, allow time for streaming propagation

### Debug Commands
```bash
# Check table counts
select count(*) from unifiedMarketData;
select count(*) from unifiedSignals where signal != "NO_TRADE";
select count(*) from backtestTrades;

# Verify data flow
select strategy_id, count(*) from unifiedSignals group by strategy_id;
select strategy_id, count(*) from backtestTrades group by strategy_id;

# Performance check
select sum(pnl) as total_pnl, avg(sharpe_ratio) as avg_sharpe from backtestPerformance;
```
